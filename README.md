# Face-Authentication-using-Siamese-Networks
Siamese Networks are one of the most popular one-shot learning algorithms. Most Deep Learning methods work really well when we have a large dataset for training. But it's not always possible to get these many images for training. Also we have to retrain the whole network to add a new class. This takes a lot of computational power and time. But One shot learning methods learn to classify using one or very few examples. This project shows how to implement one-shot learning methods for Face authentication.
