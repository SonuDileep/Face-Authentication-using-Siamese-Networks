# Face-Authentication-using-Siamese-Networks
This project was part of completion of the course, Machine Learning at Colorado State University. Siamese Networks are one of the most popular one-shot learning algorithms.â€‹ DeepLearning methods like CNN work really well when we have a large dataset for training. But it's not always possible to get these many images for training. Also in CNNs we have to retrain the whole network to add a new class. This takes a lot of computational power and time. But One shot learning methods learn to classify using one or very few examples. This project shows how to implement one-shot learning methods for Face authentication.
